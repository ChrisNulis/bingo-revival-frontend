*ABOUT
=================
This CRUD project was originally developed by myself and two other developers. Due to its age and the discontinuation of Herokuâ€™s free tier membership, the project was no longer maintained. I am now reviving this project on my own.

My objective is to enhance the existing codebase without altering the design or functionality. I plan to restructure the code to improve efficiency and adopt more modern practices. Currently, the backend is up and running but it hosted on a local server rather than Heroku.

*HOW TO VIEW the FRONTEND
=========================
1. Clone the repository: 
    git clone https://github.com/ChrisNulis/bingo-revival-frontend.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    cd bingo-revival-frontend
3. Install all the dependencies:
    npm install
4. Start the development server:
    npm start
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

*HOW TO VIEW THE FULLY FUNCTIONAL APP
=====================================
